## Why this matters
Electricity isn’t equally clean throughout the day. By shifting heavy digital activity (coding sessions, renders, large downloads) to greener periods, you can reduce your **indirect carbon footprint** with minimal effort.

## Features
- Fetches live + forecast **UK carbon intensity**
- Suggests the **best time window** for your chosen duration (sliding‑window minimum average)
- Works with **National / Region / Postcode** forecasts
- No frameworks, no build step

## Tech
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla)
- UK Carbon Intensity API
